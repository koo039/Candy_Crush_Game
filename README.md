## problem specification
>When working on large-scale projects such as Recommendation Systems or Natural Language Processing (NLP), dealing with extensive matrices is inevitable. These matrices >often consist of millions or even billions of elements, leading to significant memory consumption. To tackle this issue, we recommend utilizing a sparse matrix data >structure.
>In sparse matrices, memory usage is optimized by representing only the non-zero elements along with their respective coordinates. Each element in a sparse matrix is >represented by a quintuple: (Val, I, J, PL, PC).
>Val: Represents the value of the matrix element.
>I, J: Denote the coordinates of the element within the matrix.
>PL, PC: Pointers to the next element in the same row (PL) and the next element in the same column (PC).
>Accessing the matrix is facilitated through two arrays: TL and TC.
>TL: Array of pointers representing the list heads of the row elements.
>TC: Array of pointers representing the list headers of the column elements.
>Refer to Figure 1-1 for a visual representation of this structure.

>we've developed our Candy Crush game to address this issue, aiming to enhance our skills and gain valuable experience in game development ,
>In the "Sparse matrix" folder above ,written in the C programming language, you can find the implementation of this solution. It aims to optimize memory usage in large-scale projects by utilizing a >sparse matrix data structure. This structure represents only the non-zero elements along with their coordinates, effectively reducing memory consumption. If you're >interested in understanding how the problem works and how the solution is implemented, you'll find detailed explanations and code in the 'dsa' folder.
